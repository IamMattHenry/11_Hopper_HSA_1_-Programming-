          On June 9, 1954, San Francisco High School was born in the midst of a small but busy community. It was first an annex of the Quezon City High School and Mrs. Trinidad R. Estrada was its first Head Teacher. There were 90 first year students to start with and six members of the faculty, classes were housed in the run-down Pizano building along Morato Street.

          In September 1958, San Francisco High School Annex gained its independence from the Quezon City High School. Mrs. Trinidad R. Estrada was promoted as Principal of the school. In the same year, the City Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Pablo R. Reyes approved its holding of the first graduation had spiralled from ninety (90) students to 5,334 in 1970. The original three sections of 90 students with 6 teachers were bolstered to 144 sections with 263 teachers in 1971.

          San Francisco then moved to the 5 hectare lot and in August 1964 the City Council approved the request for an opening of evening classes and immediately 6 sections of the first year students were organized. On October 28, 1965 by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation of President Macapagal Nos. 486 and 156, this hectare lot became a permanent sit of San Francisco High School.

          In 2005 a new breed of leadership emerged. Likened to Moses as deliverer of Israel, the servant leader and a good shepherd of her sheeps Dr. Milagros A. San Juan took the reign of leading the good teachers of SFHS. Through the collaborative efforts, hardships and sacrifices of the staff and teachers, the school rose form Rank 43 to Rank 12 in the Division ranking of National Achievement Test. Believing that Peak Performance would require teamwork, she organized the School Governing Council. It was also during her term that the San Francisco High School Alumni Association was organized. Through the SGC, she was able to make stakeholders of the school to become part and parcel of the learning institution and to work together toward the realization of the school’s mission and vision which she initiated for the school.
